## Simulate Annealing and Boolean Networks

This repository contains core code written as part of my MSc dissertation project investigating the application of [Simulated Annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) to [Boolean networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_network). Boolean networks are a deceptively simple structure that can exhibit behaviour complex enough for the modelling of gene regulation and other biological networks, and Simulated Annealing (SA) offers a potential useful approach to optimising/evolving Boolean networks for a desired behaviour. Prior work on evolved Boolean networks has used SA in the optimisation of networks, but my project looked in detail at how SA could be tuned/configured for some example Boolean networks, and how SA's performance compared to a more straighforward optimisation algorithm.

The project as a whole was structured into two main packages. bnsim provides a number of classes and methods for generating and loading Boolean networks, saving networks, and iterating them. simAnneal consists of a number of classes representing components of the SA algorithm that could then be assembled into different configurations of the algorithm. The demo package contains two small demos: one for core functions of the bnsim package, and the other showing an example setup of the SA algorithm, utilising the simAnneal package.
